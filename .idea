Body: structure defined in data.json
- deser using serde
- validation
    - node
        - node xy is always >0
        - (id,pos.x,pos.y) is uniq
    - edge
        - (id,source,sink) is uniq
        - source and sink are valid node.id



    - Each driveway connects only existing nodes
        - Error::InvalidNodeInEdge
    - Each driveway is connected on both ends to an intersection node
        - Error::EdgeMissingSourceOrSink
    - Each intersection node has at least two driveways connected
        - Error::NodeNeedsMoreDriveways
    - Each intersection node should be reachable from any other intersection node
        - Error::DisConnectedNodesFound
        - This requires implmentation of a DFS with VISITED node tracking
            The time complexity seems to linear on nodes and edges
